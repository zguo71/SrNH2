This repository contains code we have used in our research on laser cooling of strontium and calcium amides.

## Surface fitting

| File  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| geomkick.py | Creates new geometries of SrNH<sub>2</sub> using optimized ground state energy. Creates and submits ZMAT file. |
| geomkickCA.py | Creates new geometries of CaNH<sub>2</sub> using optimized ground state energy. Creates and submits ZMAT file. |
| runpolyreg.py | grep all the energies in the slurm file and then create the input file for surface fitting |
| surface-fit.py | Do the surface fitting with scikit learn in python |
| surfacefit.py | An improved, more readable version of surface-fit.py |
| exclude.py | Search for all the results and rewrite an input file using the points that has a relative energy less than 2000 cm<sup>−1</sup> |
| error.py | Look at the distribution of points and then list out the points with highest and lowest error |
| crossing.py | Examines how energetically close adjacent electronic states are for each point |
| duplicate.py | Simulate the geometries generated by geomkick.py to count the number of duplicate geometries generated |
| merge.py | Combine <i>ab initio</i> data from the ground and excited electronic states into one file |
| min.py | Identify the minimum energy for each electronic state |
| slurmscan.py | Identify which <i>ab initio</i> calculations were not successfully started |

## Surface analysis

| File  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| opt.py | Performs gradient descent optimization of the fitted potential energy surface |
| carthess.py | Evaluates the Cartesian Hessian to calculate the harmonic vibrational frequencies |
